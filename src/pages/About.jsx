        various web platform like freeCodeCamp, Scrimba, Udemy etc.. With
        acquired knowledge I've done a few applications using JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS and React. Currently I'm learning NextJS, TypeScript and Tailwind
        working on real world project. Learning to code for me was the best
        decision that I've made and I hope to become really good at it. Project
